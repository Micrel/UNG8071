These are the updated files for DSA support in Microchip KSZ switches which
use the tail tagging method for port direction.  Please copy them to the
appropriate directories under the Linux kernel source tree.

Please patch the Kconfig and Makefile files in their associated directories.

The "Kconfig" file adds a new NET_DSA_TAG_TAIL configuration, which uses the
NET_DSA_TAG_TRAILER configuration for most of the operation.

The "tag_tail.c" file contains specific code for NET_DSA_TAG_TAIL
configuration.

The "setup_dsa.c" file should be included in the network driver, which needs to
call the "ksz_switch_init" function during initialization to setup the DSA
devices.  A MDIO bus is required, so the network driver should acquire that
first.  The KSZ8692 network driver contains sample code for that operation as
documented in the Microchip KSZ switch driver operation document.

struct ksz_sw *sw get_sw_ptr(struct net_device *dev)
{
	/* Get the switch pointer from the net device. */
	struct dev_priv *priv = netdev_priv(dev);
	struct dev_info *hw_priv = priv->adapter;

	return hw_priv->sw;
}  /* get_sw_ptr */

static void setup_dsa_switch(struct net_device *dev)
{
	struct phy_device *phydev;
	struct ksz_sw *sw = get_sw_ptr(dev);

	if (!sw)
		return;
	phydev = sw->phydev;
	ksz_switch_init(&ksz_switch_plat_data, NO_IRQ,
		&dev->dev, &phydev->bus->dev, sw);
}  /* setup_dsa_switch */

The following functions should be defined in the network driver as they are
used in the tag_tail code:

void net_add_tail_tag(struct sk_buff *skb, struct net_device *dev, int port)
{
	struct ksz_sw *sw = get_sw_ptr(dev);

	sw->net_ops->add_tail_tag(sw, skb, 1 << port);
}  /* net_add_tail_tag */

int net_get_tail_tag(struct sk_buff *skb, struct net_device *dev, int *port)
{
	u8 *trailer;
	struct ksz_sw *sw = get_sw_ptr(dev);

	trailer = skb_tail_pointer(skb) - 1;
	return sw->net_ops->get_tail_tag(trailer, port);
}  /* net_get_tail_tag */

The switch API add_tail_tag is used to insert the tag specific to the switch.

The switch API get_tail_tag is used to get the tag information.

As the Microchip KSZ switch requires tag tailing all the time if that feature
is enabled, it is necessary to call the "tail_xmit" function in the network
driver during packet transmission to make sure a tail tag is attached to the
packet.

This is done inside the switch API final_skb.
